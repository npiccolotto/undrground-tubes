Root barrier log...

Ordering time: 2.12s

Barrier statistics:
 AA' NZ     : 8.278e+05
 Factor NZ  : 1.106e+07 (roughly 300 MB of memory)
 Factor Ops : 4.110e+09 (less than 1 second per iteration)
 Threads    : 17

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 23.79 seconds (10.92 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 1.49s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)
