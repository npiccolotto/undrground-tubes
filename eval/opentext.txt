Finding glyphs sharing the same category was generally easier than finding exact matches of glyphes for (only) glyphcat and cat. Because I could just follow connected color lines. Finding exact matches was easier in glyphs.

===========

1) bright red would be pink to me 
2) in the tutorial I was confused about question 4 with the wording "if they share at least one category" unless I misunderstood somethin in the beginning I tought the categories would be refered to as "line color". An example picture in the tutorial would have been nice to clarify the intended result without giving the solution.
3) similar confusion as in point 2). I thought that I had to mark all glyphs that had at least one of those colors. The wording was not wrong in the tutorial but it was still misunderstood by me. A picture would have been helpful again.
4) in the tutorial the numberwing of querstions was consistent with 1-4. In the experiemnt I got confused because the numbering repeated and I tought I had accidentally continiued or broke something.

===========

I've never seen such a visualization. Therefore it was quite tricky to get into it, but I feel like it could be a good alternative in some cases (e.g the restaurant example). Although it is not as easy to read as e.g. a start rating or something similar.

Also the one question was not that clear to me:
"All glyphs that looked exactly like the reference and share at least one line."
This confused me a bit and I think I understood it wrong. When I came to the rating part the question was formulated with "category" instead of "line".
This made much more sense to me. Maybe I overlooked something in the tutorial part, but I thought that only adjacent lines were ment in that context, while doing the exercises.

===========

Found it easy

It was fine, the question for eligibility for the test in the beginning is kind of odd, because it doesn't reflect the actual eligibility in my opinion. I wasn't medically diagnosed with dyslexia, I was, however, with ADHD. A lot of the questions looked like my assessment test. I am sorry if I messed  up your data for the 2 categories questions, I literally forgot if it should be red AND blue (&&) or red OR (||) blue from a logical operations point of view and it wasn't clear from the question in my opinion.

===========

No, I don't have something to add.

===========

Distinguishing the reddish colors was a bit hard, even though i have no signs of any disadvantages with seeing colors

===========

Looking for a reference in Cat was very infuriating

===========

When I had to search a glyph in both categories (for example dark blue and dark red), I was a bit confused that I have to find glyphs with BOTH or glyphs that have also only one of these categories (for example only dark red). But could be a issue on my behalf due to lack of English skills.

===========

I disliked the question related to corrected-to-normal sight. Does a pair of glasses count. Why was this a yes/no question?

===========

I was a little confused if we have to find the glyphs, which are in both categories (AND) or if we have to find the glyphs in one or the other (OR)

===========

It needs a lot of "attention" to read informations out of these graphs. On the first sight its a bit overwhelming and i need time and have to looke carefully du get informations.

===========

Really innovative and cool idea, seams like this could be really useful. PROPS

===========

I first wasn't quite sure what the second Post-Experiment Questions were for because the questions stayed the same but the names changed for example from CAT to Category and i needed like 2 min to figure out the first questions were the preference and the second questions were the confidence because the name change threw me off

===========

Finding same looking glyphs seems to be easier for me after some time, because I only had to focus on specific points which where usually well ordered so it was easy to keep track of the ones I already went over. On the other hand keeping track of the tracks/lines was more difficult in my opinion, since they crossed it each or "skipped" points, which made it harder for me to follow them.
Summary: finding glyphs in CAT is easier than finding categories/groups/lines in GLYPH

===========

I always had to think about public transport / metro lines when looking at the visualizations

===========

The color difference between different reds or different blues isn't very noticeable, and it feels like it can sometimes cause visual fatigue and not be able to tell what color this really is. And also for this image type, I don't feel like there's a huge difference when similar image types are together. If it's about scoring, it's actually hard to see the difference

===========

I found it more easy in general to select shared categories than similar glyths as those were rather small. The size for sure impacted my confidence in always selecting the correct glyths.

===========

It took a while to remember a glyph's shape, or point distribution, probably because if one sector has one point more or less it's not that much different visually. This probably slowed performance on CAT and GLYPHCAT visualisations on the similarity tasks, because on GLYPH I could be sure, that there were no similar glyphs outside of a radius and I didn't really have to remember how the glyphs look like. 

Also on GLYPHCAT, it's nice that more similar glyphs are closer together, but it also brought a sense of uncertainty, because I detected some similar glyphs in a much larger radius so often I ended up searching through all the glyphs anyways.

===========

 It is relatively easy to find similar graphs, but if they would be rotated, another dimension is added, making the graph very hard to read. So the rotation of the graphs have to be fixed. I found that interesting.

===========

It is way easier to search for colors than to control every glyph for similarity. 
The GLYPH representation assures me that every similar glyph is in the neighborhood, while I can't be sure about that with the GLYPHCAT. So for example for task 4 I only have to focus on the connecting colors.

===========

I would have likes a second try, because in the first run, only at the end and when giving the points regarding the questions, did I fully understand the meaning behind the survey. Eg.: Terms like categorie regarding the lines etc. In the tutorial, I thought that the sectors would have more meaning in the test. Other than that I found the concept really interesting, regarding how to recognize elements fast

===========

The difference in color was sometimes hard to see for me on my device (notebook). Especially between dark red and dark blue. In the survey at the end regarding the confidence levels the placement of the different layout options was a bit misleading for me as the layouts where explained before in different order (glyphs, categories, glyphs + categories)
