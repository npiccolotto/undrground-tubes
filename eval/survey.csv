2) in the tutorial I was confused about question 4 with the wording ""if they share at least one category"" unless I misunderstood somethin in the beginning I tought the categories would be refered to as ""line color"". An example picture in the tutorial would have been nice to clarify the intended result without giving the solution.
3) similar confusion as in point 2). I thought that I had to mark all glyphs that had at least one of those colors. The wording was not wrong in the tutorial but it was still misunderstood by me. A picture would have been helpful again.
4) in the tutorial the numberwing of querstions was consistent with 1-4. In the experiemnt I got confused because the numbering repeated and I tought I had accidentally continiued or broke something.","Female","High school (A-levels / Matura)","Mouse"

Therefore it was quite tricky to get into it, but I feel like it could be a good alternative in some cases (e.g the restaurant example). Although it is not as easy to read as e.g. a start rating or something similar.

Also the one question was not that clear to me:
""All glyphs that looked exactly like the reference and share at least one line.""
This confused me a bit and I think I understood it wrong. When I came to the rating part the question was formulated with ""category"" instead of ""line"".
This made much more sense to me. Maybe I overlooked something in the tutorial part, but I thought that only adjacent lines were ment in that context, while doing the exercises.","Male","High school (A-levels / Matura)","Mouse"

Also on GLYPHCAT, it's nice that more similar glyphs are closer together, but it also brought a sense of uncertainty, because I detected some similar glyphs in a much larger radius so often I ended up searching through all the glyphs anyways.","Male","High school (A-levels / Matura)","Mouse"
